# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Project Title: Python Fun

This project is the work of `Zerihun`, a student, with guidance and mentorship from **Guillaume**.

## Script Details

### Script File
- File Name: `bracket_finder.py`
- Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Python Version: 3.8.5

### Code Description

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

for i in range(1, 10):
    if i <= 5:
        print("AAAAАННННН")
    elif i >= 6 and i <= 8:
        print("WHERE ARE ALL THE BRACKETS???")
    else:
        print("HOW DO YOU PEOPLE READ THIS SYNTAX EASILY")
```

The script, authored by Zerihun, explores if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python. The comments within the code express humorous frustrations with Python syntax.
